##Linear Regression
###Assumptions of linear Regression   
1. Linearity
2. Homoscedasticity
3. Multivariate normality
4. Independence of errors
5. Lack of multicollinearity   
###Statistical significance(alpha), Pvalue and Null Hypothesis

###Building a model   
1. All-in- If there is prior knowledge or you have to or preparing for backward elimination 
2. Backward Elimination    
Step 1. Select a significance level to stay in the model (eg SL = 0.05)   
Step 2. Fit the full model with all possible predictors.   
Step 3. Cosider the predictor with the highest P-value. If P> SL, go to Step 4, otherwise go to 5   
Step 4. Remove the predictor.    
Step 5. Fit the model without this variable.   
3. Forward Selection
4. Bidirectional Elimination
5. Score Comparison
